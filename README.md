# MDS-work-IITM

This repo contains code I wrote to work on a Medical Exoskeleton for Rehabilitation, while I was working at Machine Design Section, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

- I utilized Arduino Code to implement Position Control and Velocity Control in our motor
- I wrote Python Code to integrate the CAN Communication with the Motor.
- I also wrote Control Systems Code, using PID, MPC, and LQR to achieve a trajectory.
- I wrote some CAN integration code in MATLAB, so we could use the appropriate MATLAB toolboxes
- I wrote simulation code in MATLAB, to simulate the lower limb of a human.
